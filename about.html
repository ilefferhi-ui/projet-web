  <h2>About Us</h2>

  <p>
    Welcome to the Lost & Found Campus Manouba platform — a dedicated online
    service designed to help students, staff, and faculty of the University of
    Manouba reconnect with their lost belongings quickly and efficiently.
  </p>

  <h3>Our Mission</h3>
  <p>
    Our mission is simple: to make the process of reporting and recovering lost
    items on campus as easy and stress-free as possible. We believe that losing
    something valuable should not be a permanent setback, and that a connected
    campus community can work together to return lost items to their rightful
    owners.
  </p>

  <h3>Who We Are</h3>
  <p>
    We are a team of computer science students from ENSI (Ecole Nationale des
    Sciences de l'Informatique), University of Manouba. This platform was
    developed as part of our web development course project, with the goal of
    solving a real problem faced by our campus community every day.
  </p>

  <h3>How It Works</h3>
  <p>
    Our platform allows users to submit reports of lost or found items, browse
    through listed items using our search feature, and get in touch with the
    person who found or lost an item. The process is straightforward, free, and
    available to all members of the university.
  </p>

  <h3>Why We Built This</h3>
  <p>
    Every day, dozens of items are lost across campus — phones, keys, student
    cards, laptops, and more. Without a centralized system, recovering these
    items was nearly impossible. We built this platform to bridge that gap and
    give every student and staff member a reliable tool to report and recover
    their belongings.
  </p>
